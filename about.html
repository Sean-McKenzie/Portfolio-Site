      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>
        I've always felt like education is THE great divide in out world. Not
        that being educated automatically makes someone better than another, or
        even smarter for that matter, but the doors opened through education are
        the opportunities that can change lives and the world as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always interested in learning something new, once something peaks my
        interest I dig into it, and it becomes obsessive. I love breaking
        everything down and figuring out the pieces.

      <h1>Values</h1>
      <p>
        I've lived my life to be in service to others, I believe in self
        sacrifice for the greater good, and to put myself on the line (to
        include my life) for those that cannot do the same for themselves.
